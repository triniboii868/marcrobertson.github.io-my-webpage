        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about">I am a junior student-athlete at Oakland City University, and I am 24 years old. I was born and
            raised in the
            lovely twin island of Trinidad and Tobago. Below is a little introduction about myself! </p>

        <h2>My favorite Hobby/Interest</h2>

        <p class="interests"> I have a lot of hobbies to choose from, but my favorite hobby is playing Warzone with my
            friends on the
            weekends. One of my favorite interests is gaming, especially exploring different game mechanics, strategies,
            and the evolving world of esports. Plus, gaming is a great way to unwind, challenge myself, and connect with
            others who share the same passion.
        </p>
